# while loop:

# The while loop is used when you don’t know in advance how many times you want to execute the block of code.
#               It continues to execute as long as the specified condition is true.
# It’s important to make sure that the condition eventually becomes false; otherwise, the loop will run indefinitely,
#       resulting in an infinite loop.

i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i = i+1

# i = 0, 0 < 5 -->0
# i = 1, 1 < 5 -->1
# i = 2, 2 < 5 -->2
# i = 3, 3 < 5 -->3
# i = 4, 4 < 5 -->4
# i = 5, 5 < 5 --> out of the loop
